# CivilGamers Bug Reports

This is for CG / CC bug reports. Reports against players should be made in-game using "@admin" or on our [forums](https://civilgamers.com). You can make a bug report by saying "!bugreport" in-game or by going [here](https://github.com/civilgamers/bug-reports/issues/new).

**Sensitive reports should be made to a Server Admin or Super Admin privately.** This includes gamebreaking and abusable bugs. Abusing these bugs without reporting them will lead to a permanent ban, while reporting them may lead to a bug bounty!
